                I started to like programming during lectures on html and 'my sql' as part of my degree
                but I had doubts: “If I were to become a developer, would I sit in a basement all day, behind a laptop and in
                isolation from others?”<br><br>

                My picture of programming was heavily skewed and it took me two jobs of working closely with developers
                to fully realise that. <br><br>

        <h2>Peer led learning</h2>
        <p>Back in university, I learnt the most from working groups that we set up to study what we were taught as part of a lecture. 
            As one of the 3 main learning styles I thought that at university, kinesthetic ways of teaching were under represented. 
            
            
            As a knesthetic/auditive learner, I have never felt clearer about something I just learnt than after explaining it to someone. 
            
            I believe that reciprocity is the most important currency of our society and think that it is a recipe for prosperity. Therefore, the idea of being able to mentor others through the same phase that I will be going through excites me a great deal!

      <div class="tech-for-better">
          <h2>Tech for better</h2>
          <p>I completed my A- levels with a focus on pedagogy and psychology and spent my afternoons working at the child day care of a mother – daughter psychosomatic clinic where my mother used to receive treatment herself. 


              Coding ticks all the boxes for me: 
              An activity I am so passionate about I can focus for hours at a time and lose myself in the task. 
              Being able to give back in a meaningful way to a community I can call home. 
              
              
              The Little Window (CHAYN, 2018) project has left an impression on me and I am hoping I will be able to give back to a community I can call home.

        <h1>Peer led learning</h1>
        <p>Back in university, I learnt the most from working groups that we set up to study what we were taught as part of a lecture. 
            <br>As one of the 3 main learning styles I thought that at university, kinesthetic ways of teaching were under represented. 
            <br><br>
            Speaking for myself, I have never felt clearer about something I just learnt than after explaining it to someone else. 
            <br><br>
            I believe that reciprocity is the most important currency of our society and think that it is a recipe for prosperity. Therefore, the idea of being able to mentor others through the same phase that I will be going through excites me a great deal!

        <h1>Tech for better</h1>
        <p>I completed my A- levels with a focus on pedagogy and psychology and spent my afternoons working at the child day care of a mother – daughter psychosomatic clinic where my mother used to receive treatment herself. 
<br><br>

            Learning how to code with F&C, ticks all the boxes for me: 
            An activity I am passionate about which enables me to give back in a meaningful way to a community I can call home. 
            
        <br><br>    
            Especially the Little Window (CHAYN, 2018) project has left an impression on me and I am hoping I will be able to give back to a community I can call home.

      <h1>My Mission</h1>
      
          <p>It is my hope that by joining this course, I will be able to mentor at the F&C overseas campuses to spread the knowledge, or work with a non-profit. “In learning you will teach and in teaching you will learn.” Long term, I know that by taking part, new opportunities will present themselves: whether that be discovering good people and ideas and founding a business, or working with a company towards a worthwhile cause. I keep an open mind and am prepared to work hard.
